Here's a breakdown of potential causes and troubleshooting steps:
Possible Causes:

Missing Parameters: The request might be missing required parameters or values, or it might be malformed. 
Invalid URL: The URL might contain invalid values. 
Network and Firewall Issues:
Firewall Blocking Traffic: Your firewall might be blocking inbound or outbound traffic from Worldpay. 
Incorrect Webhook Destination: The webhook destination URL might not be using HTTPS or have a certificate signed by a trusted authority. 
IP Whitelisting: Ensure you are using DNS whitelisting and not explicit IP whitelisting for your firewall. 
Other Potential Issues:

Card Issues: The card might be expired, have insufficient balance, or have restrictions preventing approval.
